# Code Style Guidelines

## 1. Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Follow the language-specific naming conventions (e.g., camelCase for JavaScript, snake_case for Python).
- Prefix private methods and variables with an underscore.
- Use UPPERCASE for constants.

## 2. Code Structure
- Keep functions and methods small and focused on a single task.
- Limit the number of parameters in functions (aim for 3 or fewer).
- Use appropriate indentation and consistent formatting.
- Group related code together and separate different concerns.
- Avoid deep nesting; extract complex conditions into separate functions.

## 3. Documentation
- Write clear and concise comments for complex logic or non-obvious code.
- Use docstrings or appropriate documentation formats for functions, classes, and modules.
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes.
- Include examples in documentation when appropriate.

## 4. Error Handling
- Use specific exception types and avoid catching generic exceptions.
- Provide informative error messages.
- Log errors with appropriate context for debugging.
- Handle errors at the appropriate level of abstraction.

## 5. Performance
- Optimize code only when necessary, prioritizing readability and maintainability.
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms for the task at hand.
- Avoid unnecessary computations or memory allocations.
- Consider caching results of expensive operations when appropriate.

## 6. Security
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs.
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Avoid storing sensitive information in plain text; use encryption where necessary.
- Keep dependencies up-to-date and regularly check for known vulnerabilities.

## 7. Testing
- Write unit tests for all new code and maintain existing tests.
- Aim for high test coverage, especially for critical paths.
- Use meaningful test names that describe the behavior being tested.
- Keep tests independent and avoid dependencies between test cases.

## 8. Version Control
- Write clear and descriptive commit messages.
- Make small, focused commits that address a single issue or feature.
- Use feature branches for new development and merge regularly with the main branch.
- Perform code reviews before merging changes into the main branch.

## 9. Code Reusability
- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to avoid code duplication.
- Create reusable components, functions, or modules for common operations.
- Use appropriate design patterns to solve recurring problems.

## 10. Maintenance
- Regularly refactor code to improve its structure and readability.
- Remove dead code and unused variables.
- Keep the codebase clean by addressing technical debt regularly.
- Document any workarounds or temporary solutions, including the reasons and plans for future improvements.
