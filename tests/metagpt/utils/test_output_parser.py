The user wants to create a web-based version of the game "Fly Bird".

## Product Goals:

- Create a web-based version of the game "Fly Bird" that is engaging and addictive.
- Provide a seamless and intuitive user experience.
- Optimize the game for different devices and screen sizes.

## User Stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to control the bird's flight by clicking or tapping on the screen.
- As a user, I want to see my score and the highest score achieved in the game.
- As a user, I want the game to be challenging but not frustratingly difficult.
- As a user, I want to be able to pause and resume the game at any time.
- As a user, I want to be able to share my score on social media.

## Competitive Analysis:

- Flappy Bird: A popular mobile game where the player controls a bird's flight through a series of obstacles.
- Angry Birds: A physics-based puzzle game where the player launches birds to destroy structures and defeat pigs.
- Snake Game: A classic game where the player controls a snake to eat food and grow longer without hitting the walls or its own body.
- Temple Run: An endless running game where the player controls a character to avoid obstacles and collect coins.
- Subway Surfers: An endless running game where the player controls a character to avoid obstacles and collect coins while being chased by a guard.
- Doodle Jump: A vertical platform game where the player controls a character to jump on platforms and avoid falling.
- Fruit Ninja: A fruit-slicing game where the player uses their finger to slice flying fruits.

## Requirement Analysis:

The product should be a web-based version of the game "Fly Bird" that is engaging, addictive, and optimized for different devices and screen sizes. It should provide a seamless and intuitive user experience, with controls that allow the user to control the bird's flight by clicking or tapping on the screen. The game should display the user's score and the highest score achieved. It should be challenging but not frustratingly difficult, allowing the user to pause and resume the game at any time. The user should also have the option to share their score on social media.

## Requirement Pool:

```python
[
    ("Implement bird's flight control using click or tap", "P0"),
    ("Display user's score and highest score achieved", "P0"),
    ("Implement challenging but not frustrating difficulty level", "P1"),
    ("Allow user to pause and resume the game", "P1"),
    ("Implement social media sharing feature", "P2")
]
```

## Anything UNCLEAR:

There are no unclear points.
