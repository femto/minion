{"question":"A cleaning company produces two sanitizer sprays. One spray kills 50% of germs, and another spray kills 25% of germs. However, 5% of the germs they kill are the same ones. What percentage of germs would be left after using both sanitizer sprays together?","answer":"After the first spray kills 50% of germs, there will be 100 - 50 = <<100-50=50>>50% left.\nThe second spray kills 25%, but 5% have already been killed by the 50% spray, so it kills 25 - 5 = <<25-5=20>>20%.\nAfter the second spray kills 20% of the remaining germs, there will be 50 - 20 = <<50-20=30>>30% left.\n#### 30","idx":142}
