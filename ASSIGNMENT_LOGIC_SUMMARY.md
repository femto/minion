# Assignment Logic Improvements Summary

## Overview
Successfully duplicated and improved the assignment handling logic from `LocalPythonEnv` to `python_server.py`, ensuring consistent behavior across both Python execution environments.

## Changes Made

### 1. LocalPythonEnv (`minion/main/local_python_env.py`)
**Improvements:**
- Simplified execution logic to be more like `python_server.py`
- Enhanced assignment detection for displaying variable values when no output is produced
- Fixed expression handling for wrapped expressions (e.g., `print(7 * 8)`)
- Improved `_` variable handling for accessing last results
- Better handling of variable inspection vs. expression evaluation

**Key Features:**
- Shows variable values after assignment if no output is produced
- Properly handles expression evaluation and stores last result
- Support for `_` variable to access last expression result
- Variable inspection by typing variable name

### 2. Python Server (`docker/utils/python_server.py`)
**New Features Added:**
- Assignment detection using AST parsing
- Automatic display of variable values when assignments produce no output
- Added `_extract_last_assigned_var()` method
- Enhanced `exposed_execute()` method with assignment logic

**Changes:**
- Added `import ast` and `from typing import Optional`
- New method `_extract_last_assigned_var()` to detect variable assignments
- Modified `exposed_execute()` to show variable values for assignments without output

## Test Results

### LocalPythonEnv Tests
✅ All 10 test cases pass:
- Simple assignment: `x = 42` → shows `42`
- String assignment: `name = 'Alice'` → shows `Alice`
- List assignment: `numbers = [1, 2, 3]` → shows `[1, 2, 3]`
- Expression evaluation: `7 * 8` → shows `56`
- Last result access: `_` → shows last expression result
- Variable inspection: `x` → shows `x = 42`
- Print statements work normally
- Multi-line statements work correctly

### Python Server Tests
✅ All 7 test cases pass:
- Assignment handling works identically to LocalPythonEnv
- Print statements work normally
- Multi-line execution works correctly

## Benefits

1. **Consistency**: Both environments now behave the same way for assignments
2. **Better UX**: Users see variable values immediately after assignment
3. **Debugging**: Easier to verify assignment results
4. **Compatibility**: Maintains backward compatibility with existing code

## Technical Implementation

Both implementations use AST parsing to detect assignments and show variable values when:
- The code contains an assignment statement
- No output was produced by the execution
- The assigned variable exists in the namespace

The logic is implemented as a post-execution check that enhances the output without changing the core execution behavior.
